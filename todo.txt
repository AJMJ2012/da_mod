TODO:
- Blood modifier perks no longer increase the amount of blood spewed
- Dissolve Powders only activates when crouching
- Gold is Forever turns gold chunks into powder in unloaded chunks
- Dynamically increase particles
- Worms and Lukkis don't eat Holy Mountain brick, unless you want them to ;)
- Remove random aggression and friendliness from enemies (Is it even possible?)
- Damage flashes are based on the percentage of damage taken rather than the amount taken (Is it even possible?)
- Return spell adds a beam between you and it
- Slice damage is based on speed
- Add Terraria style Water Walking perk
- Teleport particles point towards the destination (Is it even possible?)
- Edit lang file for various things (Having trouble with this)
- Add a shop reroll based on their level
- Show spell descrtiptions when standing at just like perk descrtiptions.
- iframes, but only at 1 or 2 frames (Configurable)
- Rewrite Extra Life so that I can change the icon when the life has been used up. Perhaps even set a respawn point to the exit chute of the holy mountain? Like the debug teleport positions.

Maybe:
- Turn Oil Blood into a Mega Perk:
	* Rename to Cyborg
	* Bleed Oil
	* Decrease Speed
	* Change species to robot with all the benefits and drawbacks
- Everything attacks each other when you die (Just for fun)
- Spell damage modifiers affect all types of damage, not just regular damage
- Add a way to appease the gods without relying on a perk. Perhaps a hefty donation? Would have to basically apply the perk's base effect when you're at previously visited temples. Or could rebuild their chunks. Very angry gods may not be appeased.
- Plasma Beams attach to the end of the wand if fired from it
- Electricity has reduced ambient shocks, but also applies electrical damage to your projectiles and shocks melee attackers
- Freeze Field also applies ice damage to your projectiles, freezes melee attackers, and gives you frost immunity, but no longer extinguishes fires (If that's even possible)
- Change Gas Fire to Fire Aura which applies fire damage to your projectiles, immolates melee attackers, burns everything burnable around you, and gives fire immunity
- Enemies are less accurate
- Wood burns slower and colder
- Coal burns slower and colder
- Oil burns faster and hotter
- Accelerative homing increases speed based on distance rather than time
- Reduce all blood but make it all true liquid
